## About

I build data pipelines — the systems that move raw data from source to a
clean, queryable, analysis-ready state. This repository is a hands-on
collection of data engineering projects covering batch ETL, big-data
processing, scheduled pipelines, and analytics modeling.

Each project is built end-to-end on real datasets, using industry-standard
tools, with a focus on writing pipelines that actually run — not just
tutorials. Where I hit real engineering problems (memory limits, dependency
conflicts, orchestration issues), I've documented how I solved them.

## Projects

### 1. Batch ETL Pipeline — NYC Taxi Data ✅
**[View Project →](./project-1-batch-etl)**

An end-to-end batch ETL pipeline orchestrated with Apache Airflow, processing
~2.96M NYC Yellow Taxi trip records.

- **Extract** raw Parquet data → **Transform** (clean, filter, feature-engineer)
  → **Load** into PostgreSQL → **Orchestrate** with an Airflow DAG
- Cleaned 2.96M → 2.84M rows (4.2% removed); engineered trip duration,
  pickup hour, and day-of-week features
- Bulk-loaded via psycopg2 COPY with chunked batching for memory efficiency
- **Solved:** a pandas/SQLAlchemy version conflict and memory constraints on load

### 2. Big Data Processing — PySpark 🚧
**Status: In progress**

Large-scale processing of taxi data using PySpark, with results loaded into
BigQuery. Demonstrates distributed processing and cloud warehousing.

### 3. Scheduled API Data Pipeline 🚧
**Status: Planned**

A pipeline that pulls fresh data from a public API on a schedule, with
incremental loading and data-quality checks, feeding a live dashboard.

### 4. Analytics Warehouse — dbt 🚧
**Status: Planned**

Modern analytics-engineering: raw data transformed into a clean star schema
with dbt, modeled in BigQuery, and visualized in Power BI.
